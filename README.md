 #### Github (basics) 
Github is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

*BASH commands to use GitHub*

 - git clone : Copies your repository from GitHub to your local computer. 
 - git add : Takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified version in a staging area. ([link](https://medium.com/mindorks/what-is-git-commit-push-pull-log-aliases-fetch-config-clone-56bc52a3601c) for more info.
 - git add . : Stages new and modified files, without deleting.
 - git commit :  Takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository that is associated with a unique identifier.
 - git commit -m : A shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message. By default git commit will open up the locally configured text editor, and prompt for a commit message to be entered. Passing the -m option will forgo the text editor prompt in favor of an inline message.
 - git push origin master : push your local changes to your online repository.
 - git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com : indentifying in GitHub.
